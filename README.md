Recommender Systems simply put, are AI algorithms that utilize features from a reviewed, liked or a purchased product to suggest additional products to consumers. These recommendations can be based on factors such as past purchases, demographic info, their search history, time spent reviewing the product or a like, dislike or a comment left behind by these consumers. 

The idea of Recommender Systems is that if you can narrow down the pool of selection options for your customers to a few meaningful and relevant choices, they are more likely to make a purchase now, as well as come back for more down the road.

**This research is a part of the Honors Research Program conducted by Stevens Institute of Technology and I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Professor Hong Man for being my mentor and guiding me through this project**. 

Through the research topic, I hope to explore about how organizations such as Spotify, Netflix and YouTube leverage Recommender Systems to enjoy a high user share, as well as learn about the essence of approaches such as Natural Language Processing, Neural Net- works and LSTM in optimizing user recommendations, making them more relevant and more meaningful.
